# Smile

Smile is a clothing store webpage made with MERN stack. It is a made-up brand name and the clothes do not exist. Just an e-commerce store if I were to have a brand of my own.

The app is not finished and I am adding features daily to make it live.

## Installation

First clone this repo.

Install needed packages with node

```bash
npm install
```

## Note

For now it is run locally with a personal mongodb cluster. In the future app will be deployed with a live database.
